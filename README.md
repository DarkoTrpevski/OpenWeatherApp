# OpenWeatherApp that shows weather data for the cities that you add.
* Uses MVVM Architecture with Repository pattern.
* Uses Dagger2 for Inversion of Control(dependency injection)
* Uses RxJava2 and Retrofit to handle the remote connections
* Uses Room, LiveData, and Lifecycle to handle the local database
* Injects the Repository with two data sources which handle their respective parts
* TODO - Clean up the business logic a bit better
